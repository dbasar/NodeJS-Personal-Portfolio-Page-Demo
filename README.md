# NodeJS-Personal-Portfolio-Page-Demo

This is the demo of the personal webpage I had created for my spouse using Node.js. <br>
The page uses static html, css, and js files from the public folder and uploads them according to the provided url. <br>
There are two sets of static html files, one in the Turkish language and the other in the English language. The language choice is stored in a cookie and used in ensuing requests. <br>
<br>
The exact design is also used in a static page (in Turkish language) that I've created and put in this repository: <br>

To be able to view the project, you need to do the following: <br>
1- Install node.js. <br>
2- Open a terminal and navigate to where the app.js file is located. <br>
3- Type "node app" in the terminal. <br>
4- Go to "http://localhost:5000" using your browser. <br>
